# Solar-System

Welcome to my Solar System project! In this exploration, we will see how planets in our Solar System follow specific orbital patterns. Inner planets, like Earth, have shorter orbits, while outer planets, such as Jupiter, take longer to complete their journeys around the Sun. This variation in orbital periods influences the unique characteristics of each planet and contributes to the overall harmony of the Solar System's motion.

# About our Solar System

The solar system is a vast cosmic system comprising a central star, the Sun, and a multitude of celestial objects bound to it by gravity. These objects include planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other space debris. The Sun, with its powerful gravitational pull, dominates the system and governs the motion of the various celestial bodies orbiting around it.<br>
<h1>Planets in our Solar System</h1>
<b>1. Mercury:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Closest to the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: Small, rocky, and airless with extreme temperature variations between day and night.<br><br>

<b>2. Venus:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Second planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: Similar in size and composition to Earth but has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat.<br><br>

<b>3. Earth:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Third planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: Blue planet with diverse climates, oceans, and life. Earth is the only known celestial body with life.<br><br>

<b>4. Mars:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Fourth planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: Reddish appearance due to iron oxide on its surface. Has polar ice caps and evidence of past liquid water.<br><br>

<b>5. Jupiter:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Largest planet, fifth from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: A gas giant with a thick atmosphere, prominent bands, and the Great Red Spotâ€”a massive storm.<br>

<b>6. Saturn:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Sixth planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: Known for its spectacular ring system, composed of icy particles and debris.<br><br>

<b>7. Uranus:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Seventh planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: A gas giant with a tilted axis, causing it to rotate on its side. Has a faint ring system.<br><br>

<b>8. Neptune:</b><br>
Distance from Sun: Eighth planet from the Sun.<br>
Characteristics: A blue gas giant with active storms, including the notable Great Dark Spot.<br><br>
